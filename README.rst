Emancia Django Newsletter - Clean rewrite  (EDN)
================================================

A fresh approach to the codebase for the popular newsletter system, but written in terms I can understand. I realise
this breaks most people's approach to things, but I need to have a maintainable (by me, and my limitations) newsletter
system for a production site, and keeping up with the random directions and patching every once in a while is not
working for me.

Plan
----

Starting from a clean Django 1.7 (Python 2.7) base, import the original emencia elements, deconstruct them, and
gradually rebuild to a working (if more basic) state. From there, add to the feature list, which will be maintained
in the Github issues list.
