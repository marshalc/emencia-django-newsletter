Changelog

0.4

Most of these notes are from marshalc...
- Merging of many branches of development... still trying to work out what each of them changed :-s
- - Merged (in this order): emencia, haengebruegge, strycore, atiberghien, coin, nephila, ostrovok-team, kapt.
- - Used their latest version (as of 20 May 2013) typically of the master branch (or nph in a couple of cases).
- Ensuring compatibility with django 1.5.1 (marshalc)
- Premailer now uses the python premailer 1.13 package (kapt)
- SMTP mailing now can use SSL (YuChem)
- I'm not touching the bootstrap, buildout, make or setup files in my work, as I neither use them, nor fully
  understand them
- Will update the list of required packages in the docs, but for now, this is what I've had to install to make this work
